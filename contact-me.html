<h2>About Consultation:</h2>

<b>There are two types of Consultaton I offer:</b>

<h3>Free</h3>
<p>For someone who has a question on a specific point in any of my posts or has a general question in any of the fields:
   <i>1- Linux & Open Source, 2- Security & Hacking, 3- Web & Cloud Technologies.</i>
  I provide an answer based on my knowledge and experience. In case I don't have it, 
  I usually refer the questioner to the right article, paper, 
  or whatever source that is which may contain the most relative answer. </p>

<h3>Paid</h3>
<p>For a business owner who needs a consultation related to his projects 
  such as a security solution, tool, or methodology that their business needs. 
  My consultation will be charged a fee. This fee is estimated by the number of hours it will take to finish the project, 
  multiplied by the hourly rate. For more information contact me by any of the channels mentioned above</p>
