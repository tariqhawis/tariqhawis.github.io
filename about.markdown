## About Me

Hello and welcome! My name is Tariq Hawis and I'm a Cybersecurity Engineer, my works involves monitoring security events, analyze applications for security flaws, and develop security tools. In my spare time, I follow the last news in cybersecurity and technology worlds, and I also write posts at tariqhawis.com.


## Cybersecurity

### Penetration Testing

 I'm specialist in performing penetration testing on web applications to find security vulnerabilities. I do white and black box testing by analyzing source codes and examine the data flow of the given application in order to find the weak spots throughout the web pages. In Addition to my own tools, I often use other tools like Metasploit, Burp suite, and Nmap.


### Security Analyst / Digital Forensics

As a full-time cybersecurity engineer, I monitor the security events regularly using Splunk and Alienvault to collect events from many sources and correlate them to obtain evidence of cyber threats.

In case of security incidents, I work with the team to mitigate the impact, perform digital forensic using Tcpdump, Wireshark, Autopsy/Sleuth Kit, and Volatility to extract artifacts from system events, network traffic, disk images, and memory dumps to reveal clues about the case.


Cybersecurity moves at a fast pace and I enjoy learning new techniques and using new tools to help make my work more rewarding. I especially enjoy educating other people about what I learned. During the past 13 years, I did many remote classes and on-site training that I can count, covering penetration testing and digital forensic topics, in addition to my contribution to multi security awareness campaigns.
