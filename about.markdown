## About Me

Hello and welcome! My name is T. Hawes and I'm a full-time Cybersecurity Engineer. In my spare time, I write posts in my blog, conduct webinar training covering security topics, also have my share with cryptocurrency trading :)


## Cybersecurity

It's been 12 years since I started having that passion of analysing codes and surf through applications looking for weaknesses. Through all these years, I sharpened my skills and improved them until I become now Sr. Cybersecurity Engineer. 

### Penetration Testing

 I specialise in testing computer systems, networks, and web applications to find security vulnerabilities. My expertise ranging from analyzing source codes and find weak spots to write vulnerability scanning tools. In Addition to my own tools, I use Metasploit, Burp suite, Nmap.


### Security Analyst / Digital Forensics

As a full-time cybersecurity engineer, I monitor the security events regularly using Splunk and Alienvault to collect events from many sources and correlate them to obtain evidence of cyber threats.

I also have the skills to perform forensic investigation using Tcpdump, Wireshark, Autopsy/Sleuth Kit, and Volatility to extract artifacts from system events, network traffic, disk images, and memory dumps that could provide clues about an intruder.


Cybersecurity moves at a fast pace and I enjoy learning new techniques and using new tools to help make my work more rewarding. I especially enjoy working with reverse engineering the malware when I discover what the malware does and how it impacts systems.
