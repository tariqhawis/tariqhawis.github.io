## About Me

Hello and welcome! My name is Tariq Hawis and I'm a security professional with over 13 years of experience.

In my full time job I do security events analysis, security systems monitoring, white/black box analysis on web applications, and develop automation tools for my own working tasks using python and bash languages. 

I am also an active member in the security and open source community with different kinds of contributions here and there; answering questions at Quora and StackOverFlow; fix suggestions at Github issues, and many others.

In addition, I work on my own website, sharing my knowledge and experience and writing articles about security issues among other IT related stuff. And Finally I save some time to develop my own open source applications such as InjectBot, which I share with my other tools at Github.
