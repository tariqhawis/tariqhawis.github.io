       <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Tariq Hawis and I'm a full-time Cyber Security Engineer and an Information Security Consultant.</p>

       <p>During my last 13 years, I've confronted with so many attacks and infiltration attempts from hackers and bots that I can't count. And thanks to them, I learned many techniques over the time against them </p>

       <p>So I decided to launch this blog to share with you my experience and story, hopefully I can contribute even a little to make Internet better to everyone.</p>
