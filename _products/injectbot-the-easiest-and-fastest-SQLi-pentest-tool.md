# What is InjectBot

InjectBot is a web-based penetration testing tool used by web developers, penetration testers, and red teamers to check Web Applications against SQL Injection Vulnerability.


# How it Works?

InjectBot basically mimics the penetration tester and security analyst by automating the checking process of variables of web application's URL to see whether the application has input validation countermeasures in place to sanitize the user's input. This process involves sending bunch of SQL queries to the target's URL then analyze what comes back from the target by looking on the returned page for things like SQL errors or some significant changes with the theme, content, and so on. while this analysis process may take few minutes or more by the pentester, it takes just a fraction of a second by InjectBot!


# Why InjectBot?

Unlike other SQLi tools which are being used for long time now, InjectBot has re-defined the security tools from terminal-parameter-based to a web-form-based tool, not only this, but also with the faster results, and that's not just an empty claim (see demo below).

# DEMO

A complete scan to a web app showing all the above features in only 23 seconds.

# Who should use InjectBot?

Whether you are a web developer or pen tester, red or blue teamer, this tools would be perfect to be in your tools arsenal to test web applications against SQL Injection vulnerabilities.


# Requirements

* Option #1: Use Docker engine to pull and run injectbot image as described under installation section below, for more details about how to use docker, refer to [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

* Option #2: A need your own web server up and running and have PHP 7.4 plus php-curl library.


# Installation

The easiest way is to use the docker image which already has injectbot installed & updated at docker hub, just run this below command:

```bash
docker run --name injectbot -d -p 8080:80 tariqhawis/injectbot:latest
```

If you have not received any error message, go to the URL: `http://localhost:8080/`
Now InjectBot is up and running.

Second option is to clone this repository and point your web server to the cloned path.

If you have any issue with installation, contact me at [github issues](https://github.com/tariqhawis/injectbot/issues), and I will be glad to help:)

# Have an idea for InjectBot?

There are plenty of improvements this script could use, If you want to add something and have any cool idea related to this tool, please contact me using [github issues](https://github.com/tariqhawis/injectbot/issues) and I will update the master version.

If you are a PHP developer yourself, feel free to PR this tool, and I will merge the good ideas.
