# These _ tips will ___


## 1. Make it simple!

I don't mean by simple as to make it creepy black and white web pages. I just meant that it doesn't have to be built on a complex CMS platform like drupal, joomla, or even wordpress. You may arguing that those are the most popluar platforms out there and I can find plenty of developers and designers of those platforms with cheap prices. Actually that is the very reason that makes them the worst choice for a starter with web business world with no plan or knwoledge of web security or cyber security threats. 

Let me tell you this fact. In the world of Cyber security, any popular thing you hear about and have the connectivity to the inernet is a target to the hackers. Wordpress for instence is one of.., no actually, it is the most popular CMS platform on the planet. 

"According to W3Techs, WordPress powers 35% of all the websites on the Internet, including those without a content management system (CMS) or with a custom-coded CMS. Or to put it another way, WordPress powers over one-third of the web!"

This is very bad news for anyone using this platform. But the question is, Why the hackers are targeting the top web platforms? actually it's a long story that I need to dedicate a whole article for it. But for now, you need to know this, not only web platform, but any thing that is well-known to the hackers and connected to the internet is considered a honey for the hackers that needs to be eaten! Whether it is a web platform like WordPress, or an operating system such as Windows, or even a car! As long as it's connected to the internet, nothing will them stop the hackers to reach it, unless there are proper security layers on the way.

So the question is, do you really have to going through all those security measures and spent your valuable money on cutting edge servers or high quality hosting plans with all security layers that can be heard of just to open a single website with few of pages? Absolutely not. How is that?

The secret why those platforms are always vulnerable to the web attacks are two things, because it is a dynamic and has database behind.
