Choosing the hosting company for running your website is not an easy task. In fact, there are many criteria that should be considered before you decide the best one for you.

Such criteria are bandwidth size, resources capacity (CPU, RAM, Storage ..), supported programming languages (PHP, Ruby, JAVA..), and the level of protection they provide for DOS Attacks, intrusions detection/prevention and son on. 

Moreover, the type of web hosting may plays a big role, such as shared hosting, virtual servers, dedicated server, and cloud hosting.


# Shared Hosting

This is the best choice for your pocket due to its cheap cost. When choosing a shared hosting plan you will get some basic stuff for your website to be operational, things like storage space where you can upload your websites page, support for database like MySQL, some web languages like php/ruby/python and/or CMS platforms like Wordpress/Joomla, Management portal to control your site like cPanel/Webmin, FTP access (to upload website pages from your machine), and email address. Also, you will have the ability to configure your own domain address so it can point to your site, get a free SSL certificate, and a small amount of [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)) enough to run a small website with some pages and images.

People who choose this kind of hosting are looking to run their site in its early stages since there will be no much visitors expected, or they just looking for an affordable place to their blog without worrying about high bills at the end of the month!

This type of hosting, however, has some limitations, it terms of hardware and network resources on the server, they will be shared with multiple users, which means a specific allotment of resources (RAM, CPU, bandwidth, etc) are not guaranteed for your website.


### Security Advice

As I stated above, this type of hosting is good for the early stages of a web business, since you don't want to waste more money on newborn website that still unknown for search engines and social media. However, as time goes by, when your site has grown and gets hundreds or thousands of visitors a day, then your website may start facing some performance issues, and/or [cyber attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack), since your site become noticed on the internet from many people including - of course - the hackers. At this point, you need to start searching of a better kind of hosting.


# Virtual Private Server Hosting (VPS)

[VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) is the type of hosting that resides in the middle between shared hosting and dedicated server, since it provides you a complete control over the operating system, so you can login remotely with administrator account (root for linux) and change whatever packages or configurations you want. Also, unlike shared hosting, you will get a basic guaranteed resource capacities of disk space, CPU, RAM, bandwidth. So you may see in the plan the word "from" before the specification, means that this value will be the ground of the resources that will not be decreased below it.

That said, your hardware and network resources are still somehow shared with other virtual servers that are running on the server, which means the site performance will effected as well by the overall performance and the health status of the main server.

### Security Advice

Unlike with shared hosting, your website will be isolated by the disk storage from the other VPS owners on the main server, that means you will not affected by some sort of web attacks like [the web application vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)). However, attacks like [DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) may still affecting your VPS performance once it targeted any of the other VPS or the main server.

Therefore, you need to make sure that the hosting company is providing some descent solutions to protect against DDoS attacks, like having firewall with anti-DDoS capabilities that can distinguish between the attack traffic and block it while the Legitimate traffic can reach the server. Also the company should provide enough bandwidth capacity for your site, depending on how much traffic you are getting (there are many tools that can help measuring, like [AWStats](https://awstats.sourceforge.i)). These things is mandatory for you site to resists this kind of attacks. 


# Dedicated Server Hosting

Dedicated Server is the type where you have the control over everything in your server, from security to operating system. That because the hardware resources will "dedicated" for you. However, this type of servers is the most expensive one among the other types which may range between $60-80 up to hundreds of dollars, therefore, it used by people who have high website traffic and resource usage, like big companies, universities, researching centers, and for gaming and live streaming.


### Security Advice

Needless to say, because of all above elements I mentioned, dedicated servers are considered as the most robust type than the previous ones. However, even with this kind of servers, you website might still under the affection of DDoS attacks. That because network resources are still shared between you and the other customers. Thus, it is very important for you to make sure they provide enough bandwidth capacity for the size of your website, and security solutions like firewall with anti-DDoS is in place.

Nonetheless, even that the company claimed to include descent network and security features to their hosting plans, there is nothing that can confirm to you that they actually there of working properly, so better to check out their money back policy, so you can get refund any time you become unsatisfied with their service.


# Cloud Hosting

This type is now what becomes a trendy technology these days. Cloud computing in general means, the delivery of services — including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence — over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer flexible and scalable resources.

The main advantage of this type is that you only pay for what you use of services and resources. This on-demand style gives you as a website owner the flexibility to what resources and services you need for you site.


### Security Advice

Even cloud hosting does not immune from DDoS attack. However, the big giant companies like Microsoft and Amazon are providing very impressive security solutions, things like Anti-DDoS firewalls, monitoring and analysis SIEM systems to look for indicators of DDoS attacks, profiling systems that can learn your application's traffic over time to identify your legitimate traffic, and web firewall (WAF) to provide full stack DDoS protection, not to mention the sophisticated AI systems and Threat Intelligent they already have which improve and feed those solutions.
