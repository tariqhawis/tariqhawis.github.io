Choosing the hosting company and plan that will host your website is not an easy task. In fact, there are many criteria that should be considered before you decide the best  one for your site.

Such criteria are bandwidth size, resources capacity (CPU, RAM, Storage ..), supported programming languages (PHP, Ruby, JAVA..), and the level of protection they provide for DOS Attacks, intrusions detection/prevention and son on. 

Moreover, the type of web hosting may plays a big role for your site, these types are shared host, virtual servers, dedicated server, cloud hosting.


# Shared hosting

This is the cheapest choice for your pocket, this type gives you a storage space where you can upload your websites page and do some basic configuration like link your domain address to your site and configure your SSL certificate to enable HTTPS...

However, this type of hosting has limitations. Since your site is shared, that means there are other websites that are sharing with you the hardware resources such as RAM (Random Access Memory) and CPU (Central Processing Unit), network, and even the IP address. Hence, you do not have the freedom to ie. logon to the server and install some packages, or change the configuration of the server. Also you cannot ask the company to do any changes because that will affect the other customers. 

People who choosing this kind of hosting are looking to run their site in its early stages since there will be no much visitors expected, or they just looking for an affordable place to their blog without worrying about high bills at the end of the month!

### Security Advice

However, this is the type hosting that I don't recommend. And if you do care about your site's safety then I advise you to stay away from type. Why? 

By running your website side-by-side with other website then no matter your site is secure, as long there is a single one vulnerable site on the same server it will be enough to risk you website by a hack threat. This kind of hacking is very common from long time ago and still happening. In a matter of fact, hackers are preferring this kind of servers that contains a dozens sites over a server with a single site, since the first one has a higher rate for catching a vulnerable site.


# Virtual Private Server Hosting (VPS)

VPS is the type that resides in the middle between shared hosting and dedicated server, since it provides you a complete control over the operating system, so you can login remotely with administrator account (root for linux) and change whatever packages or configurations you want.

However, you hardware and network resources are still somehow shared with other virtual servers that are running on the server, which means the site performance will effected as well by other sites.

### Security Advice

Unlike with shared hosting, you will not affected by web attacks that may happened to other sites on the server. However, there is this troublesome attack that called DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) which still effecting your site whenever it targeted the container server or any other VPS in it.

That said, before purchasing any VPS, it's recommended to make sure that the hosting provider has protection layers in-place to stop DDoS attacks. 

These layers should contain well-configured firewalls with anti-DDoS capabilities that can distinguish the attack traffic and block it while Legitimate traffic can reach the server. Having a decent bandwidth capacity is another important factor to prevent the link from being saturated during the attack.


# Dedicated Server Hosting

This is the type where you have the control over everything in your server, from security to operating system. That because the hardware resources and the bandwidth capacity will be all yours. However, this type of servers is the most expensive one among the other types, therefore, it used by people who have high website traffic and resource usage, and in are need of full control of their servers.

### Security Advice

Needless to say, because of all above elements I mentioned, dedicated servers are considered the most robust type than the previous ones. However, even with this kind of servers you website still can be affected with DDoS attacks, unless you pay attention to network capabilities and security options that provided from the hosting company to the server plans. Such as bandwidth capacity, network throughput, and firewall with DDoS mitigation feature. 

Nonetheless, even with all of the above features are provided, it's not unlikely that you may still face DDoS attacks or performance/downtime issues. So better to check that they provide money back policy for their customers in case you experienced any troubles with your server simply get refund and try another hosting!


# Cloud Hosting

This type is now what becomes a trendy technology these days. Cloud computing in general means, simply put, the delivery of services — including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence — over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer flexible and scalable resources.

The main advantage of this type is that you only pay for what you use of services and resources. This elasticity gives the website owner more control over his demands.


### Security Advice

Even cloud hosting does not immune from DDoS attack, thus, it is important for the hosting provider to have Anti-DDoS solutions for their network. Such solutions as monitoring and analysis SIEM systems to monitor and analyze your website's traffic and events looking for indicators of DDoS attacks, profiling systems that can learn your application's traffic over time to identify your legitimate traffic, and finally web firewall (WAF) to provide full stack DDoS protection.
