In the cyber world, the more popular a piece of software it becomes, the more it becomes a target for the unfriendly sort of hacker, so live with this fact!

That said, platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla are by far the top 3 platforms on the Internet, which make them as well the the top 3 targets by hackers. If you don't want your site to be under the radar of hundreds of hackers around the world then you might need to consider staying away from these platforms. 

Believe me, I'm spending hours a day watching everyday security events from SIEM and WAF; it becomes ordinary to observe random sources sending arbitrary crafted exploits for one of these three platforms, although none of them are even exist in the network.

This popularity is what attracting both security analysis experts and hackers to dedicate their time and efforts finding out weakness spots on these platforms. 

WordPress now is one of the most attractive target for both folks. Since according to W3Techs, it powers 35% of all the websites on the Internet, which equal one-third of the web! So it's no wonder to see many of security researchers racing to find vulnerabilities in WordPress which resulted the huge number of findings listed in [CVE website](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=wordpress)

And yes, it's too easy for anyone to find out the exploit that need to execute on your Wordpress site to take it down! And it's available on Internet and for free of charge! included with demo of how to do it! Free websites that offer that database of exploits is like [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/), just search for any name of software and choose any exploit you like to execute! it's that simple.
