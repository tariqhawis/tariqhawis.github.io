In the world of cyber security, the more popular a piece of software it becomes, the more it becomes a target for the unfriendly sort of hacker, so live with this fact!

That said, platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla are by far the top 3 platforms on the Internet, which make them as well the the top 3 hackers' targets. If you don't want your site to be under the radar of hundreds of hackers around the world then you might need to consider staying away from these platforms. 

I'm seeing that all the time while watching everyday security events, random sources sending HTTP requests with arbitrary crafted exploits that meant to target one of those popular platforms, even though I don't have any of them in my environment. 

This popularity is what attracting both security analysis experts and hackers to dedicate their time and efforts finding out weakness spots on these platforms. 

For instance, Wordpress is one of the most attractive target for these folks, considering that it powers 35% of all the websites on the Internet, which equal one-third of the web! According to W3Techs. It's no wonder that it has a huge number of vulnerabilities listed in [CVE website](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=wordpress)

And yes, it's too easy for anyone to find out the exploit that need to execute on your Wordpress site to take it down! And it's available on Internet and for free of charge! included with demo of how to do it! Free websites that offer that database of exploits is like [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/), just search for any name of software and choose any exploit you like to execute! it's that simple.
