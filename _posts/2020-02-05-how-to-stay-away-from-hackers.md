When I say your data, I mean your life. We're living now in a world where our life that we experience with all its details is ONLINE!

You do have a Facebook profile. NOT? What about Twitter? Google account, Apple ID, Uber,...

This is not concerning only website owners. It's for everyone who has a profile in one or more of the online websites whether it's a service or a social media, or even an online game.
